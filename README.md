# Honkai Star Rail Characters' Damage By Scenarios

Compare damage from each scenario of the given character.

## Damage Simulation Disclaimers
Calculate characters' **Average Damage** based on 1,000 battles, with 30 cycles each.  

Damage was calculated by considering only on Skill, Ultimate, Talent, and Trace.  
Basic ATK was simulated for some Characters with an Enhanced Basic ATK.  

Effect of Speed buff/debuff from abilities were not simulated.   
Action Forward buff/debuff from abilities were roughly simulated if the character's damage depends on it.
 
Simulation of enemies or allies were done only to create scenarios
that could possibly trigger Skill, Ultimate, Talent, and Trace of the given Character.  
AoE Skill, Ultimate, or Talent were simulated as if they were applied to a single enemy, 
considering only DMG dealt to the targeted enemy, not adjacent enemies.

Critical damage was also considered and simulated.

The Damage from this calculation is only theoretical.  
It might not reflect Damage in real-game scenarios.

Every simulated character has 3,000 ATK, 50% Crit Rate, 100% Crit Damage, and 46.6% Elemental Damage Bonus.  
Skill, Ultimate, Talent, and Trace are at level 10.  
Characters' Speed is at level 80.
